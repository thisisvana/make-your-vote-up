         <h1>The Liberal Party of Canada</h1>
         <p>Established in 1867, it is the oldest federal political party in Canada. The party generally sits at the centre of the Canadian political spectrum,
            with strong leftist stances on many policies. The Liberals' legislative decisions include universal health care, official multiculturalism, entrenchment of Canada's
            Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and making same-sex marriage legal throughout the country. The partyâ€™s
            proposals include setting national targets to lower greenhouse gas emissions, improving infrastructure, full legalisation of cannabis and improving healthcare.</p>
