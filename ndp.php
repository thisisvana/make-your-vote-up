         <h1>The New Democratic Party</h1>
         <p>The NPD was formed after a merger between The Canadian Labour Congress and Co-operative Commonwealth Federation.
           It is a secular pluralist party despite its predecessors having populist, socialist and Christian Left affiliations.
           Led by Tom Mulclair since 2012, the party currently  identifies as democratic socialist and advocates for healthcare,
           real action on environmental issues, higher taxation of large corporations reducing poverty in Canada and the protection of LGBTQ rights.</p>
