         <h1>The Green Party of Canada</h1>
         <p>Founded in 1983, the Greens have always had leftist and centrist leanings.
           However, many Greens hold that the traditional left-right political spectrum doesnâ€™t correctly convey the pragmatic, ecological stance of the party.
            Led by Elizabeth May since 2006, the party advocates for bold climate action,social justice, sustainable economy, non-violence,  and the regulation and taxation of cannabis.</p>
